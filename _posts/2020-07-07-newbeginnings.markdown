Why did I decide to learn Software Development?
I honestly heard of FlatIron through Tiktok believe it or not. A student who graduated from the program posted multiple videos of her experience with the Bootcamp and it really intrigued me. I had been thinking of going back to school for awhile now, however I was never really sure what I wanted to do with my life. As I'm getting older it was getting more frustrating to figure out exactly what I wanted to do for my career. Those videos couldn't have popped up at a better time. I ended up looking into FlatIron right away. Everything I read about this Bootcamp were answers to all my questions and I
didn't hesitate to get started right away. Now here I am, and I couldn't be more excited about what is to come and all the new beginnings.
